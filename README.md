# Inix
Inix is a small and handy C library to handle and parse INI files.
# How to setup Inix
Inix is composed of a C source file and a C header file, the whole library is fully coded in C99 compliant code.
To use Inix, simply drag the header file in your C project as well as the C source code file.
By default "inix.c" will search for the header file in the same folder.
If it is not the case please change the "#include" path in the "inix.c" file.
Finally to use the library simply "#include" the header file in your project.
# How does the library work
A full and detailed documentation is available in the Github repository.
