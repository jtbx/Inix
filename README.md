# Inix
Inix is a small and handy C library to handle and parse INI files.

## How to setup Inix
* Inix is composed of a C source file and a header file. The whole library is programmed fully in C99 compliant code.
* To use Inix, simply copy the header file and the source file into your C project.
* By default inix.c will look for inix.h in the same folder.
* If the header file is not in the same folder, add a `-Ipath` flag to Inix's compile command.
* To use the library, simply #include the header file in your project.

## Documentation
Detailed documentation is available in Documentation.txt.

## Will Inix evolve
Inix is currently at version 1.0; the library is still at a very early stage and bugs are to be expected.
However I will keep working on the project, fixing bugs and adding new features to the library, so stay tuned.
